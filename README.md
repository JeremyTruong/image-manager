# Image Manager
A GUI developed using JavaFX which allows users manage image files from their file system. 

Features a 'paint' style drawing application where users can draw and save their creations. Images can be opened from the file system and users can add tags to categorize the images. Tags are saved upon closing the application and reloaded on start up. Within the program, users can move images to different directories.

Created by myself and three others as a team project for a software design course at the University of Toronto.

# Prerequisites
The application was developed with Java 8, where JavaFX was fully integrated Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Development Kit (JDK). In more recent versions of Java, JavaFX has been removed from the JRE. Full functionality of the program is only guaranteed given a version of Java where JavaFX is integrated.

Java SE 9 has JavaFX fully integrated, which can be downloaded here: https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase/javase9-archive-downloads.html
